# G.Meet-Exit

## To Use
- Make sure to have meet exit open in the background
- Run meetEx.py
- Lock and/or change the rectangle position by pressing [Esc]
- After several participant changes, the program will refresh the google meet therefore user exit the meeting

- User can choose to use window.getWindowCapture() [to get OBS-like screen capture] or window.getActiveWindow() [to get one specific app's capture, can't be overlap with other apps on top of it. But takes A LOT of memory from the used library; win32gui, etc.]
